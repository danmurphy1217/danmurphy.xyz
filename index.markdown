ðŸ‘‹ Hello, my name is Dan. I am a Software Engineer at ComÃºn. Previously, I've worked at Brex and ModernFi.

I love building things, and I particularly find a lot of enjoyment in working with great teams building ambitious products. Overall, the process of turning ambiguous product ideas into concrete and actionable engineering items is something I enjoy.

When I am not coding, you can find me trail running and backpacking, cycling, and participating in various endurance sports (mostly triathlons and marathons). I love the outdoors, and also enjoy photographing my adventures.

I currently live in NYC and am always up for a coffee (calendly [here](https://calendly.com/dan-comun/30min))!
