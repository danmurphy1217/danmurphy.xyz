# Pattern Recognition Beats Playbooks

Experience-based reasoning is an underrated asset. It's the ability to look at a situation and evaluate it based on patterns you've seen before: understanding not just *what* worked or didn't work, but *why*.

Someone who worked at a well-run company might tell you "we used two-week sprints and did daily standups." That's a playbook, a list of practices they observed but likely didn't design or deeply understand. Someone with strong experience-based reasoning will tell you *why* a process worked or failed. These folks have seen cause and effect, reason about tradeoffs, and are deeply introspective.

This applies regardless of whether someone came from a great environment or an average one. What matters isn't the pedigree but whether they've built pattern recognition across their experiences and can articulate why something succeeded or failed.

I've found that people who've experienced what didn't work and recognized it as such often have surprisingly good judgment. They know what *not* to do, which is different knowledge than knowing what *to* do. They can spot red flags early, and if they've reflected on what went wrong in previous roles, they've developed the kind of introspection that makes someone coachable and self-aware.

**What I Screen For:**

In interviews, I care less about where someone worked and more about how they reason about their experiences:

- Can they explain why a technical decision succeeded or failed?
- Do they understand the tradeoffs, or are they just repeating what they were told?
- When things went wrong, did they extract lessons or just blame others?

The difference is between "my last company was a mess" (just blame) and "we did X which led to Y, and here's what I'd do differently knowing what I know now" (experience-based reasoning). The latter shows someone who's building a mental model of what works and what doesn't. Over time, we build up a library of these thoughts (what I refer to as "playbooks" throughout this article). These playbooks help us avoid repeating the same mistakes over and over again, and also help us bring awareness to unfamiliar territory by drawing similarities between past and present.

**Why This Matters Beyond Hiring:**

As you gain more experience, most decisions boil down to pattern matching. When you're choosing an architecture, designing a process, or reviewing code, you're evaluating "is this good or bad?" based on patterns you've seen before (or patterns you've learned from others).

People with strong pattern recognition can reason from first principles. They don't just copy what worked at their last company. They understand *why* it worked and whether those conditions apply here. They can adapt.

People with just a playbook are stuck when the context changes.

**The Lesson:**

Keep building your library of patterns. Seek out diverse experiences. Work on different types of problems, with different teams, at different scales. And most critically, reflect on what worked and what didn't. That reflection (the introspection) is what turns experience into judgment.

Doing, and learning from both the good and the bad, is how you develop experience-based reasoning.
