# Pattern Recognition Builds Better Playbooks

Experience-based reasoning is an underrated asset. It's the ability to look at a situation and evaluate it based on patterns you've seen before: understanding not just *what* worked or didn't work, but *why* it worked in the past and *will* work again in the present. The best operators capture those why's and when's in a living playbook they can reach for the next time ambiguity shows up.

Someone who worked at a well-run company might tell you "we used two-week sprints and did daily standups." That's a playbook, a list of practices they observed but likely didn't design or deeply understand. Someone with strong experience-based reasoning will tell you *why* a process worked or failed. These folks have seen cause and effect, reason about tradeoffs, and are deeply introspective.

To be clear, I'm not anti-playbook. I'm anti "copy-paste" playbook. Pattern recognition beats a hand-me-down checklist, but it *feeds* a living playbook that you curate over time. The real edge comes from capturing the context: why a move worked, what assumptions had to be true, and when those assumptions break.

This applies regardless of whether someone came from a great environment or an average one. What matters isn't the pedigree but whether they've built pattern recognition across their experiences and can articulate why something succeeded or failed.

I've found that people who've experienced what didn't work and recognized it as such often have surprisingly good judgment. They know what *not* to do, which is different knowledge than knowing what *to* do. They can spot red flags early, and if they've reflected on what went wrong in previous roles, they've developed the kind of introspection that makes someone coachable and self-aware.

**How I Screen for This in Interviews:**

In interviews, I care a lot about how one reasons about their experiences:

- Can they explain why a technical decision succeeded or failed?
- Do they understand the tradeoffs, or are they repeating what they were told?
- When things went wrong, did they extract lessons or blame others?

The difference is between "my last company was a mess" (blame) and "we did X which led to Y, and here's what I'd do differently knowing what I know now" (experience-based reasoning). The latter shows someone who's building a mental model of what works and what doesn't. Over time, we build up a library of these thoughts (what I refer to as "playbooks" throughout this article). These playbooks help us avoid repeating the same mistakes over and over again, and also help us bring awareness to unfamiliar territory by drawing similarities between past and present.

**Why This Matters Beyond Hiring:**

As you gain more experience, most decisions boil down to pattern matching. When you're choosing an architecture, designing a process, or reviewing code, you're evaluating "is this good or bad?" based on patterns you've seen before (or patterns you've learned from others).

People with strong pattern recognition can reason from first principles. They don't copy what worked at their last company. They understand *why* it worked and whether those conditions apply here. They are adaptable to an ever-changing environment (which is great when hiring for a startup!).

People who cling to someone else's static playbook get stuck when the context changes. People who tend their own living playbook have patterns, failure modes, and caveats ready for whatever comes next.

**The Lesson:**

Keep building your library of patterns. Seek out diverse experiences. Work on different types of problems, with different teams, at different scales. Write down what happened, why it happened, and the guardrails you spotted. And most critically, reflect on what worked and what didn't. That reflection (the introspection) is what turns experience into judgment, and your notes become the cheat sheet you can revisit later.

Doing, and learning from both the good and the bad, is how you develop experience-based reasoning. Preserve those lessons and you end up with a playbook that's yours—and that's when pattern recognition compounds into faster decisions, better bets, and more opportunities you can actually seize.
