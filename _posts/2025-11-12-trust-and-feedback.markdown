# Thoughts on Trust and Feedback

One valuable thing I've learned in my career is that trust unlocks feedback. And feedback is how we get better.

As engineers, we make mistakes constantly -- during planning, in technical decisions, while coding. I've come to realize that's not the problem. The problem is when we can't talk about those mistakes openly.

I've found that trust creates an environment where feedback flows naturally. When you trust your teammates, you can be vulnerable. You can admit when you're confused about an architectural decision. You can ask for code review feedback without defensiveness. You can say "I think we're heading in the wrong direction" before it's too late.

This vulnerability isn't weakness, it's what enables growth. The most impactful conversations oftentimes start with honesty: "I'm struggling with this," "I think I could have done this better," "What am I missing?"

Here's the compounding effect: the more you engage in these honest exchanges, the stronger the trust becomes. Trust enables vulnerability, vulnerability enables feedback, and feedback creates opportunities for growth. Each cycle makes the next one easier.

**What's worked for me:** I've learned not to limit feedback to manager one-on-ones. Your peers, reports, and cross-functional partners all see different aspects of your work. I make it a habit to end one-on-ones and personal meetings by asking: "What's one thing I could be doing better?" or "What should I start/stop doing?"

It's uncomfortable at first, but that discomfort is where growth happens. I've consistently been surprised by how much people appreciate being asked.

I've found that work becomes more fulfilling when you can feel yourself improving. Trust and feedback are how I've gotten there.
