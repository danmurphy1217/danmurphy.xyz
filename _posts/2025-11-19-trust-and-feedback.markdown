# Thoughts on Trust and Feedback

Trust unlocks feedback. And feedback is how we get better.

As engineers, we make mistakes constantly -- during planning, in technical decisions, while coding, etc... But, the mistakes are **not** the problem. The problem is when we can't talk about these mistakes openly.

Trust creates an environment where feedback flows naturally. When you trust your teammates, you can be vulnerable. You can admit when you're confused about an architectural decision. You can ask for code review feedback without defensiveness. You can say "I think we're heading in the wrong direction" before it's too late.

This vulnerability isn't weakness, it's the mechanism for growth. The conversations that matter most start with honesty: "I'm struggling with this," "I think I could have done this better," "What am I missing?"

Here's the compounding effect: the more you engage in these honest exchanges, the stronger the trust becomes. Trust enables vulnerability, vulnerability enables feedback, and feedback creates opportunities for growth. Each cycle makes the next one easier.

My advice is to not limit feedback to manager one-on-ones. Your peers, reports, and cross-functional partners all see different aspects of your work. I make it a habit to end one-on-ones by asking: "What's one thing I could be doing better?" or "What should I start/stop doing?"

The discomfort of asking is the point -- that's where growth lives. And you'll be surprised how much people appreciate being asked.

Work becomes more fulfilling when you can feel yourself improving. Trust and feedback are how you get there.
