notion-ruby is an unofficial Ruby client for the Notion API, enabling developers to programmatically manage Notion pages and content. With this gem, you can add, move, duplicate, and update blocks, manage nested content, and create or update tables—all from your Ruby applications.

It was built back in 2020, before an official Notion API existed.
