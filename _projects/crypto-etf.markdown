excerpt: pos-etf is a Python project that implements an ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) on the Algorand blockchain, representing the top 10 Proof-of-Stake cryptocurrencies in circulation. With this tool, users can purchase a single diversified coin that fairly represents a split of the ten underlying assets, simplifying crypto portfolio management.
